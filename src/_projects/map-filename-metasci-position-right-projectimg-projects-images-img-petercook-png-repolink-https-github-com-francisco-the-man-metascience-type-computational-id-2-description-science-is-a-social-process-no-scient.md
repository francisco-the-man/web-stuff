projectTitle: Metascience Modelling
description: "Science is, a social process. No scientist works in
  isolationâ€”researchers build upon the work of others, relying on a foundation
  of prior discoveries, shared methodologies, and collectively established
  facts. The goal of this project is to understand how we find ourselves in
  epistemic bubbles and what kinds of markers might tell us (from the inside)
  when we are. "
